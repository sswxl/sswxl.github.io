TCP/IP协议是一大堆协议的集合，TCP/IP协议分为四层（也就是数据传输一次主要经历以下4个步骤），分别是从上到下为：应用层，传输层，Internet，物理层。

假如你给你的基友发一个消息，数据开始传输，这时数据就要遵循TCP/IP协议啦，你的电脑会做出以下动作，这些动作你是看不到的。

**1、应用层先把你的消息进行格式转换,你的消息是文字还是图片，还是成人视频并进行加密等操作交给传输层。（这时的数据单元（单位）是信息）**

**2、传输层将数据切割成一段一段的，便与传输并往里加上一些标记，比如当前应用的端口号等，交给Internet。（这时的数据单元（单位）是数据流）**

**3、Internet开始在将数据进行分组，分组头部包含目标地址的IP及一些相关信息交给物理层。（这时的数据单元（单位）是分组）**

**4、物理层将数据转换为比特流开始查找主机真实物理地址进行校验等操作，校验通过，开始嗖~嗖~嗖~的住目的地跑。（这时的数据单元（单位）是比特）**

**到达目的地后，对方设备会将上面的顺序反向的操作一遍，最后呈现出来。**

标题： “A greeting from Xiangxiang Zeng”，或者“Regarding your microRNA-disease association article”

正文：
Dear (千万不要写成Dead，如果是非英语国家的作者，可以用他的母语来问候，比如西班牙语Hola) Prof. (如果不确定是不是professor，也可以用professor让他高兴一下) xxx, 

I was working on the microRNA-disease association problem for a year at Xiamen University. I recently read your paper "......." and I think it is very interesting. But unfortunately, I have some problem when I try to implement your algorithm. Could you please send me the source code of your algorithm?

Appreciate your help.

Thanks and regards.

Dear Dr. Rajewsky

I am a bioinformatics researcher from P.R.China. My research interest lies in looking for microRNA and other computational problems. I saw your paper Natural selection on human microRNA binding sites inferred from SNP data in Nature Genetics and was very interested. Yet, I couldn't access the content since it's charged a viewing fee, which is too much to me, who have virtually a little income. 

Would you please send me a copy of this paper? or help me find a copy somewhere in the Internet? It would be very helpful for my research and I will be very grateful for your help! 


Please help! Thank you very much! 

Best regards

这里有一封成功要到代码的邮件。一般来说，大牛很乐意指教刚入门的小菜鸟，因此写邮件要代码时，态度一定要谦虚，尊重。
Dear Mr.Cao,

I am an junior undergraduate student of Xiamen University in Fujian, China.

I just took my first step in scientific research focused on data mining and bioinformatics advised by Prof.Xiangxiang Zeng in our school. Recently I read your paper "Collective Prediction of Multiple Types of Links in Heterogeneous Information Networks" published in ICDM 2014. Your clear and compact declaration inspired me a lot. But I got some trouble when I try to implement the algorithm.

So could you please send me a copy of the source code if possible? I would be very appreciated if you can help me:)

Thanks and regards.

Dear XXXXXX:
    Thank you for reading!
    I am a first-year doctoral student at XXXXXX University, China. My name is XXXX, and the chinese is XXX。
    My research is focused on Computer Vision. I have recently read your paper "On-line Adaption of Class-specific Codebooks for Instance Tracking".
    I am wondering if you could kindly send me the source program and the necessary information about it. I promise they will be used only for research purposed.
   Thank you very much for your kind consideration and I am looking forward to your early reply.

Sincerly, yours
XXX

Dear ×,

I am sorry if I disturb you, and I am a Ph.D student with a great interest in texture analysis. I have just read one of your papers titled "×", and I am impressed by your segmentation result. Of couse, you have done a perfect job.

Though it is easy to understand the basic ideas in your paper, I have difficult to reproduce the same good experiment effect with yours. Would you be kind enough to share the codes or the software corresponding to your paper? I will only use it for academy purpose. Thanks in advance. http://www.rijigu.com/

Best regards!

Dear Hongliang ,

Thank you for reading!

I am a second-year graduate student at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics University in Chengdu, China. My name is Xiaolong Wang (王小龙).
My research focuses on Fine-grained Entity Typing. Recently I read your paper "Improving Fine-grained Entity Typing with Entity Linking " published in EMNLP 2019. Your clear and compact declaration inspired me a lot. But I encountered some problems when using the code you provided to reproduce the work, so I would like to request your kind assistance.

 



Thank you very much for your kind consideration and I am looking forward to your early reply.

Thanks in advance. 

Sincerly, yours

Xiaolong Wang
